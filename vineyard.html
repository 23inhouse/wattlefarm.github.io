<h1>The Vineyard</h1>

<p>Clare Valley has a long history of winemaking with vines first established in the region in the 1840s. The 
Clare Valley geographical indication (GI) is part of the Mount Lofty Ranges GI Zone and is not so much a 
valley as a series of mostly north-south ridges and valleys. The region encompasses quite a small area - only 
35 kilometres north to south and ranging in width from 5-10 kilometres. The Clare Valley wine region is also 
relatively small in terms of planted area with only 4800 hectares under vine, which represents just 3 per cent of 
Australia's total vineyard area. Red varieties dominate - mainly Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Whites - mainly 
Riesling for which the area is famous - represent about one third of plantings.</p>
<p>At its southern edge, 110 kilometres north of Adelaide, is the historic town of Auburn.</p>

<p>The Clare Valley retains its rural character and has not been crowded by industrial or residential 
developments as with many other Australian wine regions. Well-known wine critic and author James Halliday 
compared the Clare Valley with Tuscany for its rustic flavour and Mediterranean climate.</p>

<p>The climate is moderated by the sea - the Clare Valley is only about 50 kilometres from Gulf Saint Vincent on the 
South Australian coast - with cool to cold nights and warm to hot summer days. Winter nights often fall below 0° 
Celsius. These changes in temperature are one of the factors giving Clare wines their unique character. Annual average 
rainfall is about 620mm - enough to sustain low-yielding, high quality vineyards without irrigation. Rain falls 
largely in winter and spring and the low humidity results in a low incidence of fungal disease and therefore minimum 
use of fungicides such as sulphur and copper.</p> 


<p>

Wattle Farm's predominant soil type is 'terra rossa' - red brown loamy clay over limestone - typical of the 
Watervale district of the Clare Valley. The limestone was formed when the area was under the sea and then, over 
subsequent geological time, a loamy soil formed on the surface as winter rain leached the calcium out of the 
limestone and summer sun broke it down and coloured it red by dehydrating and oxidising the iron compounds left 
behind. This layer of terra rossa topsoil is rich and free draining but thin - often as little as 100 
centimetres deep. Beneath the terra rossa soil is a band of calcrete: calcium carbonate leached out of the 
topsoil and redeposited immediately above the limestone. This calcrete layer, up to 10 centimetres thick, was 
‘deep ripped' using a laser-guided bulldozer when Wattle Farm vineyard was developed, so that the vines' 
roots can access the porous limestone below. Vine roots penetrate many metres into the porous limestone as they 
search for water.

<p>The mean January temperature is 21.9°C, similar to the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, Australia's other 
recognised Shiraz producers. This figure has been challenged in recent years on the basis that the data historically 
was from a meteorological station in an enclosed, paved courtyard. Hilltop vineyards such as Wattle Farm are likely to 
have lower long-term average January temperatures.</p>

<p>Following vintage the leaves change colour and, by late Autumn, fall from the dormant vines. During this period the 
vines take nutrients back into their root system to prepare for the next season.</p>

<p>Each year during the winter the vines are pruned by hand. This is the most important (and most expensive) 
viticultural operation, because it has a major influence on yield and quality. At Wattle Farm yield is limited to just 
a few tonnes per acre in order to maximise quality - as winemakers say, "great wine is made in the vineyard".</p>


<img style="width: 480px;" src="images/pruned.jpg" alt="A hand pruned shiraz vine – vines are carefully pruned to limit yield and maximize quality. Pruning is the most important viticultural operation performed each year."/>


<p>During the Spring the vines burst into life and after the shoots reach about a metre in length flowering starts. 
This is a critical few weeks in the growth cycle of the vine - the caps fall from the flowers and the fruit sets.</p>


<img style="width: 480px;" src="images/small.jpg" alt="The vines in Spring with newly formed bunches."/>

<p>At Wattle farm the green bunches are 'thinned' to avoid crowding to ensure air and light reach the bunches. This 
practice is used by the best fine wine producers in France - where it is known as a vendange verte, or 'green harvest' 
- so that the vines are able to put their energy into developing the remaining grapes to maximise flavour 
intensity.</p>

<p>Veraison - when the grapes begin to ripen, soften and change colour - usually occurs in mid-January. The change in 
colour is due to the chlorophyll in the berry skin being replaced by anthocyanins (red wine grapes) and carotenoids 
(white wine grapes).</p>

<p>Wattle farm produces between 200 and 250 tonnes of grapes each year. Just a few tonnes are specially selected and 
hand picked for the wine bottled under the Wattle Farm label. The rest of the fruit is machine picked using large 
machines.</p>
